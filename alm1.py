# 32-electrode NeuroNexus silicon probes recorded on a 
# PCI6133 National Instrimunts board. See 'general/experiment_description' 
# for more information

# The extracellular recording traces were band-pass filtered (300-6k Hz).  
# Events that exceeded an amplitude threshold (4 standard deviations of the background) 
# were subjected to manual spike sorting to extract clear single units [1].  
# Spike sorting was performed on data from individual recording sessions.  
# For each unit, its spike width was computed as the trough to peak interval in the mean 
# spike waveform.  We defined units with spike width <0.35 ms as fast-spiking GABAergic (FS) 
# neurons and units with spike width >0.45 ms as putative pyramidal neurons.  
# Units with intermediate values (0.35 - 0.45 ms, 39/133) were excluded from our analyses.  
# 73 neurons were antidromically activated by photostimulating the PT neuron axons.  
# 134 neurons were antidromically activated by photostimulating the IT neuron axons.  
# These neurons were further tested for collisions in which we looked for absence 
# of antidromic spikes when they were preceded by spontaneous spikes [4].  
# Neurons that passed the collision test were classified as PT neurons or IT neurons.  
# Neurons that failed the test were classified as PT-coupled neurons or IT-coupled neurons 
# because they were presumably synaptically-connected to ChR+ PT neurons and IT neurons.  
# Finally, a few cells could not be tested due to an absence of spontaneous activity and 
# these neurons were excluded from further analyses.
